The page’s title is <em>“Pollution Index 2016 Mid Year”, </em>but there’s a small link at the top to access <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/pollution/rankings_current.jsp">the “current” ranking</a> (more recent than mid-2016 supposedly).</p><p>What I saw got me really impressed with Lebanon’s achievement.

This is not only a small sample (the tiny amount of people who visit that obscure site), but it’s also a measure of “<em>perception</em>”, i.e. what people <em>think</em> the pollution levels are.</p><p>But Mustapha, the page also said that they get some pollution information from the World Health Organization. Doesn’t that make it scientific?</p><p>So, sure enough, I went to the <a href="http://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/cities/en/">WHO’s pollution page</a>, and downloaded <a href="http://www.who.int/entity/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/WHO_AAP_database_May2016_v3web.xlsx?ua=1">their database</a>.</p><p>First, there are absolutely no records about Ghana (supposedly the world’s most polluted country).

But I think the lesson we can learn from this bogus chart is that we shouldn’t immediately believe something on the internet just because it’s in line with our biases.</p><p>Is it good politically in a fight against the government?

Let it be known that I find nothing offensive in the idea of selling to people using symbols that they look up to. It’s how advertising has always worked. (I don’t see verbal pitchforks railing against actors pretending to be dentists on TV to sell toothpaste)</p><p>The critiques I agree with are the <a href="http://tarekchemaly.blogspot.com/2016/08/lebanese-army-day-ads-mostly-atrocities.html">creative kind</a> (some ads are too ugly or undignified) and the ones relating to using Israeli soldiers (some people are too stupid). I will even talk in favor of the <a href="http://claudeelkhal.blogspot.com/2016/08/lebanese-army-day-when-you-think-youve.html">insensitivity and hypocrisy argument</a> (celebrating while some soldiers are missing or dead). But I find nothing remotely rational in <a href="https://stateofmind13.com/2016/08/02/lebanon-successfully-turns-army-day-into-a-mortifying-freakshow/">this critique</a>:</p><blockquote>2016 will officially go down as the year when Lebanon commercialized its Army Day. It was probably a long time coming, but we’re officially there.</blockquote><p>Why is that bad?

But they could not go on to rally around a single candidate, and then engage in the slow, dull, grinding work of organising a political party that could contest an election,</blockquote><p>As recently as February 2016, Thomas Friedman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/opinion/social-media-destroyer-or-creator.html">wrote that</a> Wael Ghonim, one of the online leaders of the Egyptian revolution, believes that social media is very good at destroying things: Bringing down regimes, causing mayhem, breaking down social orders. But it has yet to prove that it could build things and create new orders.</p><p>Whenever we look around, it seems that Ghonim’s assessment is correct. Mass social media movements that started with the best of intentions only managed to be “Flashes in the pan”, as Fukuyama puts it. From The Honk Kong demonstrations to #OccupyWallStreet to #BlackLivesMatter, activists driven by genuine injustice managed to cause great commotion, but could not create lasting changes on the ground. (A point that is disputed because it is argued that the awareness of the injustice is an achievement in its own right).</p><h4>A Glimmer of Hope in Lebanon</h4><p>In Lebanon we had our own share of flashes in the pan: From the “Revolution against sectarianism” to the #YouStink protests, young men and women organised on social media and demonstrated loudly to drive change into a maddeningly corrupt and incompetent system, but the political class (and the mainstream masses) ignored them without consequence.</p><p>Enter <a href="http://beirutmadinati.com">Beirut Madinati</a>, a movement of professionals, academics, intellectuals and activists, who are using social media for a truly revolutionary idea: “the slow, dull, grinding work of organising a political party that could contest an election” as Fukuyama put it. They don’t call themselves a political party, which is fine, considering how toxic the term is. But they are effectively a group of people working towards seeking election to manage a very complex polity: The City of Beirut.</p><p>What is refreshing about the movement is its focus on rolling one’s sleeves and building things from within the system. It was based on an insight that the laws in place are already good enough for peaceful change that can make the city of Beirut thrive. The big revolution is the lack of any talk of revolution.</p><p>But while the movement is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BeirutMadinati/">gathering momentum</a>, their success is far from certain. They have immense barriers to overcome, from entrenched moneyed interests to the apparent lack of leadership (even technocracies require the spending of political capital and the occasional hard elbow to rule well).</p><p>If you are interested in their success, I strongly recommend that <a href="http://beirutmadinati.com">you join their online drive</a>, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BeirutMadinati/">their facebook page</a> and spread the word.

The Saudis could no longer take the dithering of its allies in Lebanon, so they decided to take action: Lebanon will no longer benefit from a previously promised $3 Billion dollar in Saudi aid to its legitimate armed forces. We now know what this is <a href="http://www.arabnews.com/featured/news/884826">about</a>: (emphasis mine)</p><blockquote>The [Saudi] Cabinet stated that its support of the Lebanese people […] was aimed at ensuring the country’s security, stability and sovereignty. This “honorable stance” <strong>was met with hostility by lebanon at regional and international forums</strong></blockquote><p>Translation: What triggered this was what the Saudis perceived as a weak condemnation by Lebanon of the Iranian mob’s attack on the Saudi embassy in Tehran back in early January. The Saudis felt betrayed by Gebran Bassil’s wishy-washy statement and concluded that there’s too much Iran sauce in it. In reality, that statement was a typical expression of the Lebanese government’s ongoing dissociation policy, aka the <a href="http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/Lebanon%20S%202012%20477.pdf">Baabda Declaration</a> (trying as much as possible not to take sides in the Iran-Saudi cold war)</p><h4>The Siren call of the Hard Line</h4><p>It is still not clear whether the Saudi action was driven by genuine despair (“Lebanon is a lost cause”), or by a desire to spur action by its Lebanese allies to turn the table on Hezbollah. It is more likely the latter, as both French and Saudi sources are hinting that the decision may not be final, and the Saudis are apparently seeking an apology from official Lebanon.</p><p>Some Lebanese supporters of Saudi Arabia are already rising to the incentive. Minister Ashraf Rifi resigned his governmental post and went to the Saudi embassy to apologise. Nadim koteish, a <em>March 14</em> stalwart and a Saudi darling, has argued that <a href="http://www.almodon.com/politics/2016/2/22/%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%86-%D9%A2-%D8%A2%D8%B0%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%87%D9%88-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%84"><em>March 14</em> should grow some balls and take drastic measures</a>:</p><blockquote>Let the second of March be the deadline. We either get a full quorum and elect a Lebanese president, or the government should resign to lay bare Hezbollah’s ongoing project of keeping a void in Lebanon</blockquote><h4>Can Harirism Survive?</h4><p>The resignation of the Lebanese government is the red line that none of the rational and responsible Lebanese leaders wants to cross. It will create the kind of void that — and it pains me to use this cliché — throws us into a dangerous unknown. Lebanon’s policy of dissociation, the one that resulted in angering the Saudis, was a rare moment of enlightenment among the Lebanese. A mature decision taken by foes, hard beaten by a long civil war, to stay out of the brewing regional storm.</p><p>One of those rational leaders is Saad Hariri. But this may not last long. The newly emboldened Saudi Arabia has departed from its long history of caution, square rounding and quiet influence. The biggest casualty of that transformation may be Harirism itself, the philosophy crafted by the late Rafik Hariri and previous Saudi administrations, which maintained that non confrontation, quiet moderation and relentless work behind the scenes will always carry the day at the end.</p><p>So far, Hariri has resisted the calls to withdraw from the government. Instead he’s trying to placate the Saudis by proving, using a <a href="http://almustaqbal.com/v4/article.aspx?type=NP&amp;articleid=694561">petition</a>, that the Lebanese people actually supports the Saudis. Meanwhile, Minister. Ashraf Rifi is playing his own game, possibly trying to prove to the new Saudis that he can be their strongman in the country. That seems to be gaining favor with some of the frustrated Lebanese. As Walid Jumblat has <a href="https://twitter.com/walidjoumblatt/status/702037941141417984">tweeted</a>: “Rifi is leading the crowds. [but] where to I do not know”. Here’s to hoping that it will lead back to sanity.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6afaaf8fe407" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://beirutspring.com/lebanon-beware-the-promise-of-a-saudi-hardline-6afaaf8fe407">Lebanon, Beware the Promise of a Saudi Hardline</a> was originally published in <a href="https://beirutspring.com">Beirut Spring</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:100:"

Not only do I consider myself an activist and proud member of the Lebanese civil society but I also believe that it is and will be the driving force behind a better Lebanon. We have a long way to go and proper action is needed to get there.</p><p>The government has dealt with the trash issue in a very reckless way. Instead of calling for an emergency meeting to find an urgent solution, they took their sweet time while the garbage was piling up shamelessly and dangerously. This demonstration needs to remind the government of their duties and responsibilities and invite them to act promptly.</p><h4>Losing Focus</h4><p>However, the current movement is starting to lose focus. If the prime minister gives in to the demands and resigns, his government will automatically turn into a caretaker government — which has already been the case since the end of President Michel Suleiman’s mandate — and since we do not have any president to consult the MPs and form a new cabinet, we will go back to square one of the issue: a president needs to be elected.</p><p>Ironically, some ministers who are both part of the government they are criticizing and also part of political groups preventing the election of a president are supporting the demonstrators. The movement has been hijacked by the cause of the problem and by troublemakers. The civil society’s response has so far been a good one by asking them not to interfere since they are part of the problem.</p><p>However, by attacking the whole political class, the image is actually being blurred and helping the real culprits get away with it. What needs to be done instead is to single out the real responsible for the current paralysis situation that the state is going through and take appropriate action. An imminent danger would be if those groups will eventually reap the fruits of this movement.</p><h4>From Chaos to Anarchy</h4><p>Our initial problem is that we live in a failed state. Instead of attacking what is left of it, we need to improve it and make sure that our state becomes efficient and functional. One of the main causes of the failure is the presence of armed groups who have repeatedly intervened in the democratic course of our country. The only way to tackle our issues without beating a dead horse is to call things by their name and face them.</p><p>We need a lot of work, we need radical change but it must be done democratically. Change should be done at the top in order to achieve what we want. But by sending out a simplified call of revolution without any viable alternative plan, demonstrators are just attempting to take us out of the organized chaos that we live in to throw us into a total state of anarchy. Ironically, the sectarian system in Lebanon will prevent this anarchy from happening.</p><p>In the meantime, one can only hope that demonstrators are enjoying this general state of euphoria — out of their collective rant — and that it will push the politicians to take immediate action concerning all of the pending issues: from collecting trash to electing a president.</p><p>Needless to say, the security forces should protect them and their right to express themselves while avoiding the same disproportionate reactions of Saturday the 22nd of August, because of few troublemakers.
